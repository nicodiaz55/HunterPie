## Introduction
On HunterPie update 1.0.3.6, a new widget was added, the abnormalities tray! It shows the buffs and debuffs you get in your hunts. The current supported buffs are:
- Hunting Horn buffs;
- Elements debuffs;
- Palico orchestra buffs;
- Consumables;
- Gear & Specialized Tools;

## Getting started
First of all, make sure your HunterPie is updated to version 1.0.3.6 or greater, in your settings tab scroll down to the Player Buffs section. By default you'll have only one abnormality tray, you can enable/disable it anytime you want by clicking on the switch in the right side of the abnormality tray settings. If you want more than one bar, click on the [+] icon, you can have up to 5 buff trays at once.
>**Note:** After adding more trays, you **MUST** restart HunterPie, otherwise it won't show your newly created trays.

## Choosing the abnormalities you want
After choosing how many abnormality trays you want, it's time to choose which abnormalities you want for each one of those trays! You can either do it by clicking on the cog icon in the right side of the abnormality tray setting, or by pressing your design mode key and clicking on the cog icon on the right top of the abnormality tray itself.

After clicking on the cog icon, a new window will open. You can choose which abnormalities you want that specific tray to show, after selecting all the abnormalities you want, just click on the save button on the bottom right to apply your changes.
> **Attention:** The abnormality tray won't show buffs/debuffs that are active. You'll have to either wait until it's effect run out and then apply it again or restart HunterPie so it can get the active abnormality.

## Orientation & Max size
When you enter design mode you can resize the buff tray like you resize a normal window. Resizing the widget will also set its max width (if your tray is horizontally alligned) or the max height (if it's vertically alligned). When the abnormality tray reaches that max size, it will start a new column or a new row to add the new abnormalities in.

You choose two different orientations for your buff tray: Horizontal or Vertical.
- Horizontal: Your abnormalities will be added to the tray side by side until it reaches the max width of your tray;
- Vertical: Your abnormalities will be added on the bottom of the last added abnormality until it reaches the max height of your tray;
