**UPDATE 1.0.3.92**

**Class Helper Widget**
Right now HunterPie supports 7 out of the 14 available classes, more classes will be supported in the next weeks, so please be patient.
- Added Longsword helper
- Added Bow helper
- Added Hammer helper
- Changed Insect Glaive helper to match the in-game layout

> **Note:** If you haven't played in BETA branch yet and have no idea how the new helpers work, please scroll up a bit for a more detailed post of the new helpers.

**Player Data Exporter**

HunterPie now exports your basic character data such as Name, HR, MR, Build URL, Session ID, Steam Session ID to a `json` file. You can use this to add commands to your Twitch Bot to keep track of your Session ID, build, etc. You can read more about this feature [here](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie/wiki/Player-Data-Exporter)

**Abnormalities Widget**
- Frostcraft and Blastscourge are displayed as percentage instead of timer now.

**Damage Meter Widget**
- Added option to hide timer, so you can show only damage now if you want.

**Other Changes**
- Launch game button no longer requires the game executable path.
- Monster Part Structures are now printed on console when the Debug message option is enabled.
- Console now saves all printed messages in a Log folder on exit.
