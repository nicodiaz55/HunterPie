The patch notes window now uses Markdown! That means all information about the latest update will be way more organized and have a more complete explanation.

**Harvest Box Update**

- Added option to toggle Steam Tracker;
- Added option to toggle Argosy Tracker;
- Added option to toggle Tailraiders Tracker;
- The Steam Tracker now formats the texts properly:
    - E.g: If you have 80,000 fuel, it will be displayed as 80k;

**Discord Rich Presence**

A new feature for the Rich Presence was added. Now people can ask to join your session directly from Discord! You can also disable this function in your HunterPie settings window.
> **Note:** The person **MUST** have HunterPie in order to join your session, since HunterPie handles both requests and join Discord functions.

A join request will popup when someone requests to join your session.

**Debug**

- Added option to load a custom monster data for debugging purposes.

**Core**

- Added option to change the delay between memory scans. Setting it to a low number will make HunterPie more accurate at cost of CPU usage. Making the delay higher will make it use less CPU but take more time to update the overlay/data;
- Latest Session ID is now saved in a Sessions.txt file.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed crown problems due to floating precision;
- Fixed ailments not showing buildup after timer is over;
