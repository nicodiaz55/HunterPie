# Honey Hunters World Integration

## Build Exporter
### How does the build exportation works?
HunterPie gets your current character gear, converts all the IDs into valid IDs used by Honey Hunters World and then builds the right link structure based on your gear.

### How to export my build?
After you login on your character, the "Upload Build" button will become visible, just click on the button and a notification will appear on the bottom of HunterPie. The notification gives you two options: `Copy To Clipboard` and `Open in Browser`
- **Copy To Clipboard:** Will copy the whole link to your clipboard, so you can paste it wherever you want.
- **Open in Browser:** Will open the link directly on your default browser. It will **not** copy the link to your clipboard.

## Exporting Decorations & Charms
Click on the **Export Gear** button in your HunterPie console after you've logged on your character. It will generate two `.txt` files in your `.\DataExport` folder.
